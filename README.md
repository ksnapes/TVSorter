# TVSorter
Sorts tv shows and movies based on entered tags.

Note that this is a work in progress! It is quite basic at the moment.

Future features
* ability to dynamically drop an item from a list \n
* automatically generate file names based on shows in folders
* give the option to sort shows based on system generated tags
* renaming feature, to get rid of junk names and make them look tidy
